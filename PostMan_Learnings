PostMan:

1. Proxy 
		 - Acts a 'security barrier' b/w your Internal Network and Internet, keeping others in the internet away from accessing info from internal network
		 - An Application/system that acts a intermediate b/w your System (Client) and Internet(Server).
		 
2. SSL

		- Secure Sockets Layer
		- Security Technology for establishing Encrypted link b/w Web server and Browser
		- SSL certificate is needed to enable HTTPS connection
		
3. API

		- Set of Protocols that allows communication b/w two systems
		- Application Programming Interface 

4. EndPoint

		- An URL which allows to access webservices (make requests) running on a server
		- It is the One end of a communication channel
		- Acts as a touch point when API interacts with other system
		- Each EndPoint is the Location (where resource lives) from which an API can access the resources
		
5. Resource

		- Information returned by an API (or)
		- Data set that is returned by a request
		- same resource can often be accessed by multiple different endpoints.
		  Also the same endpoint can return different resources, depending on a query string.

6. Parameters

		- Options one can pass with the endpoint. e.g. Response format, amount returned

   Types
	
		1. Query Parameters - Parameters in the query string after endpoint, after (?) and seperated by (&)
		e.g. https://amazon.in/search?id=1&name=google
		2. Path Parameters  - Parameters within the path of endpoint, before ? e.g. https://amazon.in/search/{id}
		3. Header Parameters - Parameters included in Request Header, usually for authorization
		4. Request Body Parameters - Parameters included in Request Body, usually as JSON. Often used with POST request
		
7. Common Methods

		- GET   -> Retrieve Data from Server
		- POST  -> Create New Data in the Server
		- PUT   -> Replace existing data in the Server
		- PATCH -> Update the existing data fields
		
8. URLEncoding

		- Also known as Percent Encoding, is a mechanism of converting non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet
		- Replaces with % followed by Hexadecimal values
		
9. Integrate with CI/CD:

		- Use NewMan - command line collection runner for PostMan

	Setting Up NewMan:
	
		1. Install NodeJS (.msi) installer
		2. Verify installation is complete. In cmd line, "node -v"
		3. Verify Node Package Manager is installed. "npm -v"
		4. Install NewMan. "npm install -g newman"
		5. Export Collection,Environment and Global Requests and Variables in JSON format
		6. Go to the file directory -> cmd -> run the below code
		
		"newman run collectionname.json -e environment.json -g global"
				
		- To run multiple times,
		
		"newman run collectionname.json -e environment.json -g global -n 2"
		
		
	SetUp Jenkins:
	
		- Install Jenkins war 
		- Run the war file. java -jar jenkins.war ; To run in different port ; --httpPort=8081
		- http://localhost:8080
		- New Item -> Freestyle Project -> Build -> Configure -> Execute using Windows Batch Command 
		-> Enter the path of .json files 
		-> Enter the same newman code
		
		Example:
		
		cd C:\Users\S.Y.AHAMED ASIK\Desktop\SNOW
		newman run SN-NewMan_col.json -g globals.json -e CR_env.json
