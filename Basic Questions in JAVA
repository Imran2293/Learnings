Basic Questions in JAVA:

1. Can Class Name and Source File Name be different?
 Yes, only if the class is not public ; run using cmd promt
 
2. Can we have multiple classes in a single .java file?
 Yes, It can be either nested in a single class (or) multiple independent classes.
 Note: But only Public class allowed as its name should be same as file name
