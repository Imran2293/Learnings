Mocking - when dev team doesn't complete the api devolopment but asked the testing team to have a mock api created
		- Used for temporary developement of api
||r to Stub | Skeleton in Manual testing
- Dummy system
E.g. Wiremock - 

<dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.tomakehurst</groupId>
            <artifactId>wiremock</artifactId>
            <version>2.26.3</version>
        </dependency>
		
Session ID: Available in Cookies tabs 
Even non API appications validations can be done using Postman for test data,
--Application should allow cookies - to get the session id to travel through the application
Important Usage: Create Data using API easier compared to Selenium

API vs Non API Applications:
--> Integrate Several appications [E.g. ServiceNow - uses Remedy, Incident..] - Uses API
--> Independant Applications - No need of APIs

For PUT: body is mandatory
	GET: body is optional
